Exporting this software probably won't get you kudos.

This is the RC5 Key client designed and written for the RSA Data
Security Contest.  The client distributed mainly in binary form,
contains unrolled routines for quickly comparing ciphertext words
for possible matches.  This client contacts the RC5 Key Server,
which handles the distribution of keyspace, zero.genx.net.  All
keys contain a default mask of 0x0000000FFFFFFF which should take
roughly 35-40 minutes to exhaust under typical modern desktop
workstations.  The Silicon Graphics R5000 180Mhz Indy systems which
it was designed on performs in under eight seconds (130-140 thousand
keys per second) with the benchmark measurements [-m].

Keyspace is assigned pseudo-random-selectively from the server and 
the client exhausts this assigned space sequentially.  The server 
hands out higher probability keys first, saving unlikely patterened 
keys for late distribution.
